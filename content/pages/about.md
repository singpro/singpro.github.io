Title: About 

SINGPRO merges Big Data platforms, machine learning and data analytics methods with process
planning and scheduling optimization. The project, funded by academy of Finland, is a collaborative
effort between Aalto University ([Professor Iiro Harjunkoski](https://people.aalto.fi/iiro.harjunkoski), Department of Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineering) and the University of Helsinki ([Professor Keijo Heljanko](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/contacts/persons/keijo-heljanko-a31015115688f87cc1ac406e5310be29), Department of Computer Science).

The goal of the project is to create online, reactive and anticipative tools for more sustainable and
efficient operation leading to an agile, self-aware and flexible decision-making loop. SINGPRO will
enable the tracking of abnormal situations (i.e. anomaly detection), identifying process equipment
performance degradations (i.e. predictive maintenance) and anticipate process timing deviations (i.e.
process behavior prediction). This helps to select the best production strategies in order to maintain
production and energy efficiency as well as sustainability targets in rapidly changing market situations
through data-driven self-adaptive scheduling models.
