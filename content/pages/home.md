Synergistic and intelligent process optimization (Singpro) is a project 
that will merge Big Data platforms, machine learning and data analytics
methodologies with process planning and scheduling optimization technologies. It will apply these
technologies to provide online, reactive and anticipative tools for more sustainable and efficient operations.

The currently employed classical mathematical optimization models are limited by fixed parameter sets,
which are commonly updated off-line and represent only statistical averages. Such parameters could be
estimated much more precisely in an on-line fashion using Big Data technologies. By creating such
collaboration interfaces between scheduling optimization, big data analytics and machine learning, the
process related decision-making will become much more agile, self-aware and flexible.
